Emotion Detection from Text 🎭
📌 Project Overview

This project is an Emotion Detection System that classifies emotions from text using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning.
It supports both real-time single text prediction and batch prediction via CSV upload.

The application is built with Python, Scikit-learn, and Streamlit, and provides an interactive interface for emotion analysis.
